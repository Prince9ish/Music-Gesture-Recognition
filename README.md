# Music-Gesture-Recognition-
The motivation for the project is the infotainment system in BMWs which uses gesture control as one of its input to control the systems. After additional research, we uncover that such systems ( in a sense ) exists on the market for computer. However, the ones found after extensive usage, found that such systems uses the bulletin camera which needs to calibrated every time and required the lid to stay a certain angle which may be uncomfortable for viewing. In addition to the fact that older computer would barley function due to the lower resolution of their built-in camera.
